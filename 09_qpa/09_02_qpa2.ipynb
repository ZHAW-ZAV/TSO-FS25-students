    "\n",
    "This exercise deals with the topic of quantitative process analysis using the example of a security check in a fictitious airport terminal. Use the DES simulation model of an M/M/c queueing system provided below for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise focusses on the following topics:\n",
    "* PART A: You will deal with the topics transient vs. steady state of a DES simulation model. You will also compare the steady-state results with those of an analytical queuing model (which you are familiar with from the INFRA-AD module).\n",
    "* PART B: You will analyse the influence of initial conditions on the results of a DES simulation model (especially on the transition between the transient and the steady state).\n",
    "* PART C: You carry out a $2^k$ factorial analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this exercise is based on the chapters *Analyzing Outputs of DES Simulations* and *Experimental Design* of the **TSO Quantitative Process Analysis Script**.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## PART A: Transient vs. Steady-State\n",
    "Below you will find the software code for a DES simulation of an M/M/c queueing system. The DES model is parameterised via the global variables in the *Parametrisation of Simulation Model* block. The simulation results for the delays experienced by the passengers (i.e. waiting times in the queue) can be found in the dataframe `df_delays`. The resulting queue lengths can be found in the dataframe `df_queue_lengths`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the DES simulation model of an M/M/c queueing system provided below with the specified parameters for the following tasks:\n",
    "1. Create a plot showing the delay experienced by the passengers vs. the passenger index. Plot the average delay, the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentile.\n",
    "2. Based on the plot created from Task 1, determine the transient phase (warm-up) and the steady-state phase.\n",
    "3. Compare the average delay in the steady-state with the results of an analytical model for an M/M/c queueing system. Information on the analytical model of an M/M/c system can be found in the INFRA-AD documents (e.g., see video [*Queueing System Models*](https://zhaw.mediaspace.cast.switch.ch/media/t/0_4x5ixao3/7740?))."

We analyse the influence of two **factors**, namely (i) number of servers `SERVERS` and (ii) average service rate of a server `SERVICE_RATES` on the **response** average delay in steady-state conditions. For this purpose, we have defined both factors as vectors, the first element of which describes a low (-) state and the second element the high (+) state. The simulation model below then performs `NUM_RUNS` for all combinations of the two analysed factors and saves the results in dictionary `results`.\n",
