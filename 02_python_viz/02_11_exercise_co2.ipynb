    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will analyze the CO2 emissions of different countries. The data is provided in the file `co2_emmissions_by_state.csv`, starting from the year 2010. The data contains the following columns:\n",
    "- `YEAR`: Year of the data\n",
    "- `MONTH`: Month of the data, from 1 to 12\n",
    "- `STATE_NAME`: Name of the country\n",
    "- `STATE_CODE`: Two letter code of the country\n",
    "- `CO2_QTY_TONNES`: CO2 emissions in metric tons\n",
    "- `TF`: Number of flights\n",

    "This dataset is provided by EUROCONTROL and publicly available [here](https://ansperformance.eu/data/) and the description [here](https://ansperformance.eu/reference/dataset/emissions/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains the calculated emissions from all IFR flights departing from a EUROCONTROL member state. For instance, the total CO2 emissions for the full trajectory of a flight from Brussels to New York would be included in the results for Belgium. A flight from New York to Brussels would however NOT be included in the results for Belgium.\n",

    "## Tasks\n",
    "This exercise is guided and you will be asked to implement the visualizations step by step. You are free to use Plotly Express and/or Graph Objects. The tasks are:\n",
    "1. Load the data and prepare the data for visualization\n",
    "2. Overview of the CO2 emissions\n",
